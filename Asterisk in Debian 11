the functions will be extented by time!!! until 2.Nov voice email, recording function and database will be implemmented. 
as well as the advantage and disadvantage for Inter-Asterisk-eXchang protocol.

1. install Asterisk 16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1 after you have install debian 11.
- sudo apt install asterisk asterisk-dahdi

2. create two asterisk client, a link for sip configuration https://www.voip-info.org/asterisk-config-sipconf/
- put the following text to file sip.conf in /etc/asterisk
[general]                                      :a section when  If thereâ€™s no match at all, the call will be sent to the context defined in the [general] section 
context =m default
[1001]                                          : a section with client name 1001 
type=friend                                     : type is entity, which is both peer and user, peer autheticate at registray, user authenticate to reach its service with context.
context=from-internal                           : the behavious of asterisk entity, which are defined in extensions.conf and can be jumped by Goto App.
host=dynamic                                    : The host parameter specifies the hostname or IP address of a SIP peer or user    
secret=password                                    
disallow=all                                    : disallow all codec   
allow=ulaw                                      : allow codec as preference

[1002]
type=friend
context=from-internal
host=dynamic
secret=password
disallow=all
allow=ulaw
           
- 
3. create a asterisk dialplan. A dialplan extension, a set a actions carried out by asterisk server in sequence, when the number is dialed. 
- add the following code to extensions.conf in /ect/asterisk
[from-internal]

exten=>1001,1,Dial(SIP/1001,20)     : every action have this format : exten = extension,priority,Command(parameters)
exten=>1002,1,Dial(SIP/1002,20)        




4. record a voice is with the command record and with Playback to play it.
exten = 1000,1,Answer()
same = n,Wait(1)                    : use the same entity as the above exten. 
!!!???same = n,Record(hello-world.gsm)     :here come a the issue of wirte and read permission of the files in the server!!!???
same = n,Playback(hello-world)
same = n,Hangup()

5.voicemail(global network is needed.)
- add the following code to the voicemail.conf
[general]
format = wav

1001 => 4711,Bing,brucke2015@gmail.com
1002 => 0815,Alex, alex@example.com

6. add a postgre database server to asterisk.(asterisk db have a bdb,which is a berkeley database, which does not support sql, but is very fast, when the 
system only deal with a small mount of dialing, dbd is eought. since there is no difficult task as transaction and sychronization.)

7. use agi(asterisk gateway interface for python)
